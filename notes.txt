This is a currency convertor webapp
we are fetching the data from an API

we have used tailwind css for styling

we have written our custom hook "useCurrencyInfo"
    - It fetches the data from API and return it in json format
    - whenever we change the currency type in "FromCurr" InputBox it fetches the data again 
    - we have used "useEffect" hook to fetch the data every time we change currency type and given "currency" as 
    dependency, currency is currency type
    - we have used "useState" hook to store the data returned by API in object format
